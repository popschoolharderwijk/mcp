# NEVER do this
* ❌ `cd C:\git\popschool\mcp && ...` or any `cd` to the workspace path — you are already in project root
* ❌ `npx ...` — use `bun run` or `bunx` instead

# Always do this instead
* Run commands from project root (current directory). Use **`bun run <script>`** for scripts (e.g. `bun run ci`) or **`bunx <pkg>`** for one-off tools

# Windows / PowerShell
* Respect the platform; don't use `head` or `grep` as these commands are unavailable on Windows/PS. Use PS equivalents.
