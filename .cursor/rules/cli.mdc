* Remember the development platform (Windows). Use PowerShell-compatible commands:
  - ❌ `cd dir && bun dev` (Unix)
  - ✅ `cd dir; bun dev` (PowerShell)
  - ✅ Or run commands separately

* CRITICAL: don't use `npx biome ...`, use `biome ...` instead
* CRITICAL: never use `cd` to the project folder; we are already in the project folder
